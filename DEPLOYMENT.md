## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

### Code Preparation
- All development and testing completed
- Code reviewed and approved
- TypeScript builds without errors
- No debug code or console statements

### Security Review
- Environment variables are secure
- No sensitive data in client-side code
- Database security policies tested
- Authentication flows verified

### Performance Testing
- Application tested with realistic data
- Database queries optimized
- Bundle size analyzed and optimized

### Documentation
- All documentation updated
- Environment variables documented
- Deployment procedures prepared

## Vercel Deployment

Vercel provides excellent Next.js hosting with automatic deployments and global CDN.

### Setup Process

1. **Prepare Repository**: Ensure code is in main branch and builds successfully
2. **Vercel Account**: Create account and install Vercel CLI if needed
3. **Project Configuration**: Configure `vercel.json` in repository root
4. **Deploy**: Use GitHub integration (recommended) or CLI deployment

### GitHub Integration

1. Connect GitHub repository to Vercel dashboard
2. Configure project settings:
   - Framework: Next.js
   - Root Directory: `rrlc-app`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Output Directory: `.next`

### Environment Variables

Configure required variables in Vercel dashboard:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Supabase anonymous key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Service role key for admin operations
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production`

Set up different environments for Production, Preview, and Development.

### Custom Domain Setup

1. Add custom domain in Vercel Project Settings
2. Configure DNS according to Vercel's instructions
3. SSL certificates are automatically provisioned and renewed

## Alternative Hosting Options

### Available Platforms

- **AWS Amplify**: Full-stack deployment with CI/CD
- **AWS EC2**: Virtual server deployment with PM2
- **Digital Ocean App Platform**: GitHub integration with automatic builds
- **Netlify**: Static site deployment with serverless functions

Each platform requires environment variable configuration and proper build settings.

## Environment Configuration

### Required Variables

Production deployment requires:
- Supabase URL and keys
- Node environment settings
- Security configuration
- Optional: Analytics, monitoring, and email settings

### Security Best Practices

- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use different keys for different environments
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Monitor key usage for security
- Use platform CLI tools for secure variable management

## Database Setup

### Supabase Production Configuration

1. **Create Production Project**: New Supabase project with appropriate region
2. **Apply Schema**: Execute database/schema.sql in Supabase SQL Editor
3. **Configure Storage**: Set up application-documents bucket with RLS policies
4. **Performance Optimization**: Create indexes for better query performance
5. **Verify Setup**: Check all tables, policies, and storage configuration

### Database Backup

- **Automated Backups**: Supabase provides daily backups (7 days retention on free plan)
- **Point-in-time Recovery**: Available on paid plans
- **Manual Backups**: Can be created via dashboard or custom scripts
- **Additional Backup**: Optional cloud storage for enhanced backup strategy

## Domain and SSL

### Domain Setup

1. **Add Domain**: Configure in hosting platform dashboard
2. **DNS Configuration**: Set up A records, CNAME records, and verification TXT records
3. **Domain Verification**: Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)

### SSL Certificate Management

- **Automatic SSL**: Most platforms (like Vercel) automatically issue and renew certificates
- **Custom Certificates**: Can be uploaded if needed
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Automatically redirects HTTP to HTTPS

### Security Headers

Configure security headers in `next.config.ts` for enhanced protection:
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- Referrer-Policy
- Content-Security-Policy

## Performance and Monitoring

### Performance Optimization

- **Build Optimization**: Configure Next.js for production with compression and image optimization
- **Bundle Analysis**: Monitor bundle size and optimize large dependencies
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement edge caching and static generation where appropriate
- **Database Performance**: Use connection pooling and optimized queries with proper indexes

### Monitoring

- **Application Monitoring**: Use platform analytics (Vercel Analytics) or custom monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Implement error monitoring with services like Sentry
- **Health Checks**: Set up API health check endpoints
- **Performance Metrics**: Track response times, error rates, and user activity

## Backup and Maintenance

### Backup Strategy

- **Database Backups**: Automated daily backups through Supabase (7 days retention)
- **File Storage Backups**: Regular backups of uploaded documents
- **Code Repository**: GitHub serves as code backup with tagged releases
- **Custom Backup Scripts**: Additional backup scripts for enhanced protection

### Disaster Recovery

- **Recovery Time Objectives**: Database (2 hours), Application (30 minutes)
- **Recovery Procedures**: Database restoration, application redeployment, DNS failover
- **Backup Verification**: Regular testing of backup restoration procedures

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues
- **Build Failures**: TypeScript errors, missing environment variables
- **Runtime Errors**: Database connection issues, file upload problems
- **Performance Issues**: Slow page loads, database performance problems

#### Emergency Procedures
- **System Down**: Check platform status, review error logs, implement maintenance page
- **Data Corruption**: Stop operations, identify scope, restore from backup
- **Deployment Rollback**: Use platform tools to revert to previous deployment

### Support and Escalation

- **Platform Support**: Vercel and Supabase support channels
- **Development Team**: Internal escalation procedures
- **Response Times**: Critical (1 hour), High (4 hours), Medium (24 hours)
